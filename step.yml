        A mapping of Alpha-2 Codes to Country that this script will support.

        **Example** Seperate the keys with new line. E.g:
        ```SG=Singapore
        AU=Australia
        ID=Indonesia```
        I.e. if your tag has AU, it will output build params:
        $GRADLE_BUILD with the Australia name, i.e. bundleAustraliaGmsRelease
        $GRADLE_TEST with the Australia name, i.e. testAustraliaGmsReleaseUnitTest
        $SLACK_REGION as the mapped value, i.e. Australia

        **Example** Seperate the keys with new line. E.g:
        ```B2BCL=XX
        AU=au
        ```
        I.e. if your tag has AU, it will output build params:
        $ALPHA_2_CODE as the mapped value, i.e. au (NOTE: this is used in our internal Prod-Build-AAB-2.0 workflow!)
        $PKG_NAME will be generated with the alpha-2 code, i.e. com.example-app-name.au
